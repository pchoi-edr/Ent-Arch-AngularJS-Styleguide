# Directives

* Name your directives with lowerCamelCase.
* Use `scope` instead of `$scope` in your link function. In the compile, post/pre link functions you have already defined arguments which will be passed when the function is invoked, you won't be able to change them using DI. This style is also used in AngularJS's source code.
* Use custom prefixes for your directives to prevent name collisions with third-party libraries.
* Do not use `ng` or `ui` prefixes since they are reserved for AngularJS and AngularJS UI usage.
* DOM manipulations must be done only through directives.
* Create an isolated scope when you develop reusable components.
* Use directives as attributes or elements instead of comments or classes, this will make your code more readable.
* Use `scope.$on('$destroy', fn)` for cleaning up. This is especially useful when you're wrapping third-party plugins as directives.
* Do not forget to use `$sce` when you should deal with untrusted content.
