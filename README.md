# Introduction

The goal of this style guide is to present a set of best practices and style guidelines for one AngularJS application.  
These best practices are collected from:

1. AngularJS source code
2. Source code or articles I've read
3. My own experience

**Note 1**: this is still a draft of the style guide, its main goal is to be community-driven so filling the gaps will be greatly appreciated by the whole community.

**Note 2**: before following any of the guidelines in the translations of the English document, make sure they are up-to date. The latest version of the AngularJS style guide is in the current document.

In this style guide you won't find common guidelines for JavaScript development. Such can be found at:
